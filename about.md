My name is Dejan Kos and I'm a software developer from Croatia.  
I have a lot of experience as backend developer in Java and some in Kotlin, Scala.  
Lately I've been enjoying programming in Rust.

My main points of interest are software performance, distributed systems, algorithms and data structures.
When I'm not programming I enjoy reading, biking, hiking and observing the universe.
